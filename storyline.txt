Got it! Let’s extend the **Tech City Story** to include your new steps, weaving them naturally so it stays easy and fun to remember:

---

### 🚀 **“Building a Tech City” – Extended Backend Adventure**

1. **Project Setup**
   You buy the land and lay the foundation.

2. **Express Setup**
   Build the city roads to connect everything.

3. **Directory Structure**
   Design the city layout — districts for routes, controllers, and services.

4. **Initializing Prisma**
   Hire the clerk (Prisma) to manage citizen data.

5. **Creating User Model**
   Blueprints for citizens — defining what info to collect.

6. **Environment Variables**
   Secure vault with city secrets (DB credentials, ports).

7. **Route Definitions**
   Put up signboards and maps to guide traffic.

8. **User Signup System**
   Create the registration office so citizens can sign up safely.

9. **User Login System with Prisma & JWT**
   Build the **city gate** where returning citizens prove their identity with a special token (JWT) — no fake IDs allowed!

10. **Advanced Error Handling with Prisma**
    You set up **emergency services** that catch any city problems with precision, thanks to expert error subclasses. If something breaks, they respond quickly and clearly.

11. **Effortless Data Validation with Zod & Prisma**
    Before a citizen registers or passes the city gate, **customs officers** check all forms with a strict checklist (Zod). No invalid or incomplete papers get through!
